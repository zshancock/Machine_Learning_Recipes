# Machine Learning Recipes
## Zac Hancock (zshancock@gmail.com)


### Motivation

This repository is going to house several recipes and serve as a cookbook for me. It is a collection of machine learning algorithms that I have called on many times in my MS Data Science program at Syracuse, and wanted to present them in a way that can be quickly called upon on any machine/computer. 

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.5+**
* Jupyter Notebook for any files .ipynb
* **sklearn (aka sckit-learn)**
* pandas
* numpy

May need other libraries as needed, but nothing too surprising for anyone who would ever need these recipes for analysis (i.e. matplotlib, etc)


### Contents

This is a work in progress, but I intend to add the following at a minimum:

- [X] Data preprocessing quick tools
- [ ] Decision Tree Regression & Classification
- [ ] Random Forest Regression & Classification
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)
- [ ] SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
