# Machine Learning Recipes
## Zac Hancock (zshancock@gmail.com)


### Motivation

This repository is going to house several recipes and serve as a cookbook for me. It is a collection of machine learning algorithms that I have called on many times in my MS Data Science program at Syracuse, and wanted to present them in a way that can be quickly called upon on any machine/computer. 

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.5+**
* Jupyter Notebook for any files .ipynb
* **sklearn (aka sckit-learn)**
* pandas
* numpy

May need other libraries as needed, but nothing too surprising for anyone who would ever need these recipes for analysis (i.e. matplotlib, etc)


### Contents

This is a work in progress, but so far it contains:

- **Data_preprocessing** (quick tools for manipulating data and formatting data)
- **Classification** (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
